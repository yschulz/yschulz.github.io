                        Hello world! This is Yannick :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Engineer, developer, german angliophile, hobbyist and simply a creative person. 
                        I love to indulge myself in creative work to balance the analytical load that goes hand in hand with my profession.
                        Engineering has helped me hone my skills in this area of crafts and I certainly believe the creativity has done the same to my problem solving skills. 
                        And although web 2.0 (or 3.0) offers great ways to express yourself, I have never been a fan of the social media aspects that come with them.
                        Hence, my own website had to become reality.
                        I want to share, but mostly archive projects, learnings and ideas in a convenient way that suits them and myself.
                        And while doing so, trying myself at some web development, would just add another item to this list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope you enjoy! 
                    </p>

                    I really don't like the expression "think outside the box". 
                    Thinking outside the box makes you come up with hundreds of unfeasable solutions to your problem.
                    However, if you define the borders of your problem's box and actually get to know what's inside, that content will solve your problem 99.99% of the time!
                    It's about how to put the tools together, not to reinvent the wheel. <br>

                        Inspiration
                    </h2>
                    <video src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/yschulz/yschulz.github.io/dev/video/blog/yannick-schulz-goldsmithing-demo.mp4" autoplay muted loop class="blog-floating-media"></video>
                    <p>
                        I have to admit, I have a bad habit.
                        Whenever I see something that entices me, I directly go in my head to the thought: "I can do that as well!" <br>
                        Some may say this is an early onset of the "dad-like" antagonism of calling professionals to fix certain things, but I actually don't find the appeal in digging through waste-water to fix a broken pipe.
                        For me, that sentiment is more rooted in creation, trying new things and learning new skills.
                        My inspiration to try goldsmithing for instance comes from a video I watched on YouTube. 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JerryRigEverything">JerryRigEverything</a> is, what his name already suggests, a creator, who tries, tests and modifies tech, but also builds and rigs almost anything.
                        One of his projects was to build the wedding ring of his fiance out of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpne-RZDOqQ">piece of her wheelchair</a>. 
                        It is a really cute story and I recommend checking it out! 
                        Since I have always loved to work with metal, but welder, lathe or mill do not fit in my appartment, goldsmithing seemed like a nice avenue to explore. <br>
                        With the enticement sorted out, I just needed something smart and quirky to do.
                        And this design by <a href="https://www.desideriacollection.com/">Desideria Collection</a> came for that calling.
                        They produce a necklace piece, that comes right out the genre pocket puzzle.
                        The necklace piece "Ring Necklace" can hold a ring securely in display without any hinge or mechanism to hold it and can be put on without taking the necklace off.
                        A really amazing design and I endorse their page and business fully! <br>
                        But let's cut to the chase, shall we?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-section one" id="section2">
                    <h2>
                        Prerequisites
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In most workshops of a goldsmith you will find one heavy duty machine. A roller to cold-roll the bullions in different gauges roughly to size.
                        If you are doing this regularly and even multiple times a day as a business, this can greatly speed up the process and increase quality of life, all the while not necessary.
                        You could take on the journey, throw the piece on your anvil and smash it like the Hulk into submission.
                        A workable solution, but requires an anvil and probably very leniant neighbors if you happen to live in an appartment building. <br>
                        One of which is true for me, so I had to come up with another idea. 
                        Instead of manufacturing the design from a solid piece of gold, I would take a round gold profile to achieve the perpendicular shift between the vertical and horizontal segments with minimal use of a hammer.
                        But let's establish a list for what is needed in that project first:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gold profile ~100mm with an outer diameter of 3mm</li>
                        <li>At least one steel hammer and a mallet</li>
                        <li>Flat pliers</li>
                        <li>Some fabric tape</li>
                        <li>Gold solder</li>
                        <li>Boric acid and (denatured) ethanol</li>
                        <li>Flux</li>
                        <li>A small blow torch</li>
                        <li>A third hand</li>
                        <li>A rotary tools with some cut and drill attachments</li>
                        <li>Files</li>
                        <li>Fine grid sand paper and polishing compound</li>
                        <li>PPE and some fire protection</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        With these tools and utensils it should be perfectly possible to make a replica of the Ring Necklace of decent quality.

                        Prototyping
                    </h2>
                    <video src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/yschulz/yschulz.github.io/dev/video/blog/yannick-schulz-goldsmithing-prototype.mp4" autoplay muted loop class="blog-floating-media"></video>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            In any project, one should never forget about the importance of proper planning, including prototyping, when the investment into that project, may it be time or money, exceeds the comfortable threshold of risk.
                            In this case, the risk is not too high, since gold holds its value pretty neatly, I could resell scrap with minimal loss.
                            However, it turns out that gold is not that easily accessible, especially in a specific extrusion format and dimension.
                            I didn't find any source within the Netherlands that provided round gold profiles or even at all in retail.
                            So I opted to source the raw materials from a UK website, that provided the piece in the designated format.
                            In order to avoid complex tax filings between countries (gold bullions for investment purposes are taxed differently than raw materials, so there is particular interest in cross country gold trade by tax offices), I tried to stay within the bounds to still be taxed right through the website and just buy one piece.
                            And here arises the necessety to prototype the manufacturing process regardless. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Selecting a substitute for gold is fairly easy. Copper pipes are a common choice in any hobby store for a lot of thermal installations.
                            Copper is very similar in thermal conductivity, melting point and elastic module, which makes it perfect to test out how the deformation affects the material.
                            And without getting into too much detail and anticipate the process, I want to share what I learned:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is not possible with hammering and filing alone to remove the separation of the metal sheets at the ends to a negligible degree. This is not entirely cosmetic, since this is also true for the holes in which the chain may get stuck sliding through.</li>
                            <li>Buckling at the bending radii is a concern relative to the wall thickness. Due to the perpendicular shift in orientation the vertical elements buckle inwards the closer it is to the apex of the bend. Filing this off uniformly may break through the material.</li>
                            <li>Asymmetric bending may introduce visual asymmetries at the bend on the horizontal element.</li>
                        </ul>

                </div>
                <div class="blog-section one" id="section4">
                    <h2>The Thing</h2>
                    <div id="section41">
                        <h3>Shaping</h3>
                        <p>
                            Beginning with the plain gold tube, I measured and marked the middle and outer bending apices.
                            Now, despite the work piece being hollow, some hammering is required to bring it into shape.
                            An anvil is still out of the question and my makeshift alternative requires a hard surface and the corner of the steel hammer as prop-up bending die.
                            Given, this is not in any way sufficient to perform a clean bend of a tube, but since buckling of the tube is actually desired in this case, the end justifies the means.
                            Upon the first strokes I noticed considerable difference in malleability between the prototype and the gold piece.
                            The website did not give an indication if the extruded gold was heat treated in any way. 
                            Enough reason for me to believe that the piece is hardened by the extrusion process and needs to be annealed before proceding with finishing the sharper bends.
                            This could lead to breaking off of the delicate wings.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="section42">
                        <h3>Annealing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Annealing is the process of reducing stresses within a metal that may have formed through different processes. 
                            Most common is the hardening through deformation like bending, or in fact extrusion. 
                            The metal is therefore heated above its recristalization temperature and slowly cooled down, so that it recristilizes in a less stressful microstructure configuration.
                            In process engineering this can get quite complicated with heat cycles for different work piece thicknesses and alloys as time and energy costs often play a huge constraint.
                            However, in goldsmithing circles, I have found that people just recommend to "hold it into the fire until it faintly glows dark red, that should be alright then".
                            And what's good enough for them, is certainly good enough for me.
                            The cookbook continues as follows. Take equal parts of boric acid and denatured ethanol and mix it. 
                            Before the work piece touches any flame, it should be dunked into this mixture.
                            The ethanol works as a carrier liquid to cover and adher to the work piece surface.
                            The evaporating ethanol leaves a film of boric acid on the shiny metal to protect it from unnecessary oxidation during the process.

                        <h3>Soldering</h3>
                        <p>
                            Coming from my background, soldering involves a tin wire in one hand and the soldering iron in the other, with the goal of joining two conductors with the minimal amount of solder possible.
                            Naturally, without any critical assessment, I went for a gold wire solder.
                            Now, the biggest difference in gold soldering is, that despite its being called soldering (by goldsmiths), it is actually brazing. 
                            This is arguably the same, however brazing normally involves higher temperatures (roughly above 300°C), which consequently means a higher risk of oxidization and hence failure of the braze.
                            Next, while it is still desirable to use as little of solder as possible, the goal is not to maximize electrical conductivity within the joint, but make it look as nice as possible in the end.
                            And this may require more solder than originally thought. At this point I unfortunately started to run into time constraints. 
                            Initially, this project was deemed to be a gift and the giftable date creeped ever so closer. 
                            My first soldering attempts, trying to apply the same principles of tin soldering, failed pretty quickly.
                            One big problem was the size of the torch I was using.
                            I knew, that because gold is such an excellent conductor, the heat I put into the work piece will quickly flow through the entire mass and dissipate through the surface area.
                            Following that, it was hard to make the solder flow into the solder joint or area I wanted it to.
                            This also impaired the left wire, right torch kind of way, because as soon as I was able to bring the solder up to temperature, the piece already cooled down and the liquified solder reather stuck to itself and formed a drop at its end.
                            So I had to change the gameplan. Finding a way to heat up both, solder as well as the piece, and decouple the amount of solder that I need to use from the rest of the solder so it can't stick to it.
                            But with this realization, I have used up all of the solder I have acquired earlier and shipping from UK was not in the time budget anymore.
                            Instead, I made some calls to local goldsmiths, politely asking if they would sell me some gold solder.
                            And before I get to the person who made my day, I have another little excursion. <br>
                            So, not being originally dutch, I didn't know a fact about the jewellery market here.
                            I always thought yellow gold jewellery comes in 9, 14 and 24 karat, which refers to the gold content in the alloy, 33.3%, 66.6% and 99.9% respectively.
                            In fact there are actually even more desired compositions.
                            Since gold is a fairly soft metal, 9kt gold, while being also the cheapest, is not only the most durable, but is also supposed to be the easiest to work with and excellent choice for me.
                            The Netherlands however, in their infinite wisdom, decided to drive a different path. For whatever reason, there is a legal limit to gold.
                            So, as a person that sells jewllery, if you were to sell a 9kt gold ring, you cannot call it a gold ring.
                            It may look like gold, it may contain gold, but it is a "silver ring", which obviously is less marketable than a "gold ring".
                            Hence, nobody in the Netherlands actually sells 9kt gold. Tough luck I guess. <br>
                            But enter the stage <a href="https://www.odinski.com/">Sonja Hunefeld</a> from Odinski Jewels in Den Haag.
                            In fact, also special thanks to <a href="https://www.daphnemeesters.nl/">Dafne Meesters</a> and <a href="https://lauriehermeler.nl/">Laurie Hermeler</a> for directing me and explaining the dutch 9kt situation to me. 
                            When I was stranded without any solder, she agreed to sell me a piece of a, not 9kt, but 14kt gold solder plate, with which I was able to at least continue. <br>
                            Going back to the actual issue at hand from <a href="#section3">Section 3</a>. the two layers at the ends had to be joined by soldering.
                            Now, with the additional information on how to approach gold soldering, I cut two pieces of the gold solder plate in shape to just fit into the squished tube.
                            The plan is to clamp the solder inside the tube in order to heat up, both work piece and solder unifromly and let the solder not escape anywhere it is not supposed to flow.
                            As said as done it worked like a charm. It has to be said, that there is a degree of color difference between the 9kt and 14kt gold, however, this is expected to be negligible, once the piece is done with a mirror finish.

                        <h3>Finishing Touch</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the shaping and soldering part is finished, it gets to the nitty gritty part of the job. Making it look neat.
                            As to this point, the piece looks quite beat up, bulges and buckles from the nature of the tube, a few oxidization spots here and there and it still misses the eyelets for the chain.
                            The latter part is easily managed by milling out a diameter at the appropriate locations at the ends of the wings with the rotary tool. 
                            Furthermore, good practice is to keep excess length of the work piece until the bending is done, so it can simply be cut to spec at this point.
                            Much more difficult is the act of grinding down the surfaces and edges.
                            Not because of the fact that it is a particularly streigneous task, but because of what was learned in prototyping in <a href="#section3">Section 3</a>.
                            Grinding too greedily can result in a wall breakthrough in particular areas, such as the buckling in the bending apices.
                            But the plan was pretty clear, getting the surfaces flat and shape the rest of the piece by a medium grid file, use coarse sand paper on all negative spaces, such as aforementioned dangerous area and consecutively increase the grid up to 5000.
                            All that would be left is polishing the piece with jeweller's rouge. Jeweller's rouge is a fine reddish colored polishing compound that leaves a close to mirror finish.
                            However, not speaking from particular experience or authority, I don't really think it matters too much, which compound you choose in the end. 
                            Reading up on it, leaves you with more questions than answers regarding which is the best one to use and it feels more like a bro science than anything else.
                            Take what you have, is accessible or you feel most comfortable with. <br><br>
                            But, but, but... If it just went this smoothely.
                            When filing down the face of the horizontal bar, it happened and I broke through the wall. 
                            When filing off the surface uniformly, there must have been some slight warping of the material from an unclean bent or the heat treatment, that I didn't account for.
                            Efforts to seal the damage by flowing more solder into it were unfruitful and at such a prominently exposed area, the color difference of the 14kt solder became just too prevelant.
                            Since the deadline passed, this particular project was put on hold. But I have learned a lot and maybe will return to this particular piece.
                            In the meantime I tried myself on some other ideas I gathered and came up with during experience.
